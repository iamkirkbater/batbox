# BatBOX
A simple Time-Tracking-by-Project application.

This project is designed specifically for a single-use case, however I felt I wanted to make it open source in case anybody else wants to use it.

If you make any improvements or add any features I am very open to including them, so long as they are well-written and documented.  *PULL REQUESTS WITHOUT TESTS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED*.

This project started out as a experiment in TDD and Web application development, and will probably evolve into a Client/Server experiment as well.
